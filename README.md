# Team Xerbutri

The proof of concept for the new Team Xerbutri website.

Team Xerbutri explores abandoned buildings, railway tunnels and bridges. The website is about urban exploring, enjoy the
pictures.

## Technicalities

As can be read in the documentation, the website gets its data by reading json files. So we need a local server to serve
these up for us, because the browser won't do this for us.

## Getting started

Go to the terminal.  
Type: "npm run dev"  
It will start up a localhost and serve the files.

## Color scheme

Basics:  
White font on black background: #000000, #FFFFFF  

FAB Button lighter colors should have:  
Background: #B7865E or #E0C28D
and font: #481E05
