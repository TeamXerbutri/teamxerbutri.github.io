# Routing

## Context

### Version 5

The current version of the website is a PHP application. The website is hosted on a server and the content is stored in
a database. The website is a multi-language website and the content is managed by a CMS

It has 3 templates/controllers for the website:

- Home
- Avontuur (Blog)
- Maps

The backend logic constructs the pages from a data model it gets from the database.

It has a nice separation of concerns, returning html pages with the data from the model.
The current Js is just for small interactions.

### Version 4

This is a PHP website, collecting data in the backend depending on the route, and returning a php page with the data
from the collected sources.

### Version 6

The new version should be backward compatible to version 4 and 5 routes.
