# Code conventions

## Status

Go!

## Decision

- Use lowercase characters only (no caps) for filenames
- Use English as language for all code and comments
- Always end an object definition with a semicolon
- Use quotes around string values

## Rationale

- Apache/Linux are case sensitive, so we need to be careful with filenames

## Consequences

We need to rename all files to lowercase.
