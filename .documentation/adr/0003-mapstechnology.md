# Maps

The current version uses OpenLayers.
What are the alternatives, and is this still the go-to choice in 2024?

## Status

Go

## Decision

Use OpenLayers to avoid scope creep.

## Rationale

- Avoid scope creep


## Consequences

Openlayer, Leaflet, mapbox and google maps are the most popular choices for mapping applications.
Mapbox and Google Maps are not open source, and need commercial licenses for some use cases.

### OpenLayers

Openlayers is a good choice for the current project, but it is not the only choice.
This is the best choice for complex mapping applications requiring deep customization and integration with various data sources.
