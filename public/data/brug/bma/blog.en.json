{"intro":"\n\t<p>We visited the bridge while following the abandoned railway from Maastricht towards Hasselt. The bridge is out of use. It's a nice urban exploring object. </p>\n\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t<p>In 1856 a bridge was build crossing the Maas for the Railway Aachen - Maastricht - Hasselt. In the second world war the bridge was totally destroyed. When rebuilding this piece of railway track didn't have priority so only in 1954 a new bridge was build. In 1990 the track was put out of use. In 2007 or 2008 the railway will be reopened, several projects are well under way.</p>\n\t\t\n"}
