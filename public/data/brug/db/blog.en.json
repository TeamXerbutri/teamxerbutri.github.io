{"intro":"\n\t\t<p>The bridge spans 172 meters and has two extensions of 40 metres. We visited this bridge end of 2005. When we visited the bridge it was being renovated, so the bridge wasn't in use. It was fun, but more thanks to the bright sky, the moon and the atmosphere.</p>\n\t\t\n\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t<p>The bridge was build in 1966 because of the widening of the canal. It replaced the old bridge from 1900. At the end of 2005 the DEMKA-bridge got a renovation. When the \"Utrechtboog\" will be opened the DEMKA bridge will be put in use again.</p>\n\t\t\n"}
