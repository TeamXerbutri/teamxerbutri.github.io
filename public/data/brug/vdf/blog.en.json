The bridge is situated in the middle of France. It was very cool. The bridge was still in use at the time of visit. At the end of 2007 the track was taken out of service. Officially because of safety reasons, but there weren't many trains driving over its track.</p>\n\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t<p>The design of the bridge was made by FÃ©lix Virard in 1901, it was inspired by the bridges build by Eifel.
