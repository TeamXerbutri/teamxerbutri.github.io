{"intro":"\n\t<p>I visited this bridge in 2004. I read about it on the dutch website spoorzoeker.nu and I just had to see it. The bridge is out of use since 1983. It's a monument these days, but little is done to preserve it.</p>\n\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t<p>In the nineteenth century the Nederlandse Rijnspoorweg Maatschappij build a railway in order to break the monopoly of CME. From Kleve the railway went north. It crossed the Altrhein and water-meadows by a long bridge. When build, the railwaybridge was the longest bridge in its kind. Near the factory of Spyck the train crossed the Rhine by boat (!).\n\tNear Elten the railway was connected with the line from Arnhem to Emmerich. <br>\n\tIn 1880 the railway companies of Germany got nationalized and charges were equalized. The weird connection between Kleve and Elten became pointless. But the crossing of the rhine by boat continued till the thirties. After that the railway from the north bank of the Rhine to Elten was closed. The railway from Kleve to the south bank of the Rhine remained in use for passengers till 1960 and for freight till 1983. <br>\n\tIn the second world war the Allies build a bridge across the Rhine connecting Spyck with Emmerich. After the second world war the bridge was removed.</p>\n\n\t\t\n"}
