{"intro":"\n\t\n\t<p>I visited the location in april 2007 after a tip from my grandpa. He told me about all the abandoned potato flour companies, so I did some research. Most of them are not abandoned, only closed, they can be taken into use again at any time.\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t\n\t<p>In 1908 or 1909 the factory was opened. In 1944 the factory was bombed during the big week campaign. After the war the factory got repaired. In 1963 or 1964 it closed its doors. The factory was used for different purposes, for example as studio space for local artists. In 1996 the upper part of the chimney was demolished. There are plans to re-use the factory terrain, but not much is happening in the mean while.\n </p>\n"}
