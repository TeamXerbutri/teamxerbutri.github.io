{"intro":"\n\t\n\t<p>I wanted to visit this site for quite some time. However as these buildings were abandoned by the dutch military, parts of it were immediately destroyed. The monumental buildings were rented to the demolition company and students.\n\tSo I visited this shooting range of this barracks in June 2007.\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t\n\t<p>The barracks were build in 1936 in the neighbourhood of an old fortress in use by the Dutch army. The barracks were build as a normal village and were camouflaged as a church and farms. In the second world war the\n\tGermans occupied it. After the war the infantry of the dutch army used the site. In 2004 the barracks were abandoned by the army due to cuts in the defense budget. It will be reconverted into a residential area.\n\t</p>"}
