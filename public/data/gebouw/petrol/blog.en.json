{"intro":"\n\t\n\t<p>We visited this industrial area in February 2007. This visit had a kind of infiltration-style. One of the team members wanted to climb the oil storage vessels. So we threw him out of the car and had a rendez-vous on a shunting yard. He didn't get busted.\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t\n\t<p>Around 1900 the first petrol activities took place in this area. In the sixties these activities moved north to the new harbours. \n\tThe area will be abandoned soon. After a huge clean up a new residential area will be built.\n </p>\n"}
