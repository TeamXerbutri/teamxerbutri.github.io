{"intro":"\n\t\n\t<p>We discovered this factory using Google Earth. We visited it in july 2007. The factory is actually dismantled, packed and shipped off to China. However there are enough buildings to climb and take some pictures. And it was considered valuable enough by the security in order to guard it. So we were busted again, however running away worked this time.\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t\n\t<p>Source: Wikipedia. In 1986 the Ruhrkohle AG, Germanies largest producer of coal, decided the cokes factories Hansa and Emperorchair II should be replaced. A five year planning was made in order to build the most modern cokes factory in the world. In 1992 the cokes factory was completed and production began. However in the late eighties and the nineties the demand for cokes in Europe fell, due to the closing of many factories. When in the end of 2000 the blast furnaces of Thyssen were closed, the most modern cokes factory of Europe lost its single most important customer and production was halted. Midway 2003 the factory was sold off to the Chinese. The factory was dismantled, shipped off to China and rebuild again.\n\tIn 2004 only ruins were left of the once so proud factory. In 2006 production in China began, with great difficulty. In october 2007 the two 165 meter tall chimneys were demolished. It is not clear what is going to happen with the terrain.\n </p>\n\t\t\n"}
