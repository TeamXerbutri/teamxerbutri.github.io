{"intro":"\n\n    <p>I was looking for this big abandoned building I discovered some time ago, but apparently they had torn it down already. In the mean while I drove by this building thinking it might be interesting. So I decided to take a look. I guess it must have been a building from the company with a name like Heumans. The building is hollow from the inside, and it is dark. Dog shit is lying around everywhere. I didn't like the atmosphere. After 10 minutes I was outside again. Boring and a bit scary, don't bother to pay it a visit.</p>\n\n    ","adventure":"","history":"\n\n    <p>No historical information available</p>"}
