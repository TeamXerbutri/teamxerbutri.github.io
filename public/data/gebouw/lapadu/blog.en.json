{"intro":"\n\t\n\t<p>During Urbexation 2007 we were at the Landschaftspark Duisburg. This is a kind of industrial park for tourists and interested people from the neighbourhood. It is not as much fun as a real abandoned factory.\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t\n\t<p>On this place in 1902 the Rheinische Stahlwerke founded a factory. The factory made iron and steel from iron ore. In 1985 all activities were stopped due to strategic reasons. The factory remained closed and from 1991 to 2002 the area was converted into the landschaftspark it is today.\n\t</p>\n\n"}
