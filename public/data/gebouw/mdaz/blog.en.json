{"intro":"\n\t\n\t<p>Discovered and visited in March 2007. I was railtracking and doubted for a second if I would enter the place. I visited the southern part of the military domain.\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t\n\t<p>In 1946 the Belgian army established Military Domain Astrid on German territory. It was a barracks and a material- and munition depot. In 1995 the domain was abandoned. The city of Stolberg is changing the domain in an industrial area. The buildings are stripped by vandals, not much to see here. Buildings are demolished in 2013.\n </p>"}
