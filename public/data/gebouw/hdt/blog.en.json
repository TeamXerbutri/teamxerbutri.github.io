{"intro":"\n\t\n\t<p>I heard from friends this building was going to be demolished. So I decided to pay a visit. I couldn't get in, the security was tight and all possible entries were blocked. I did not have any time for a revisit before they demolished it.\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t\n\t<p>In 1971 the new head quarters of the DAF company were build and in 1972 the doors opened.<br>\n\tIn 1993 the largest truck builder of the Netherlands went bankrupt. The head quarters were abandoned by DAF, but rented to other companies.<br>\n\tThe tower is abandoned since 2002. An investment company bought the tower from DAFTRUCKS and wanted to convert it into student buildings. All did not work out because the government wouldn't allow it. The story goes that the building contains lots of asbest.<br>\n\tIn 2006 DAF bought the tower from the investment company with the intention to demolish it. Somehow they did not use the demolition permit in 2006. So they reapplied in 2008 and again got a permit. This time work went on fast, the tower was demolished in a few months.\n\t</p>"}
