{"intro":"\n\t\n\t<p>This is a location we found by smart use of topographic maps and our sixth sense. There are more such locations in the neighbourhood, but they are not as accesible and nice as this one. We visited the location in June 2006 and had a nice nature walk.</p>\n\t\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t\n\t<p>This location was used by the Belgian army.
