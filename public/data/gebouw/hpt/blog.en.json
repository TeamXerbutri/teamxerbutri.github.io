{"intro":"\n\n    <p>I discovered this location in June 2006. It is a silo used to store cement for building a highway. I spoke to some people living in the neighbourhood.

It is well possible to catch some kind of scary disease in this place.</p>\n\n    ","adventure":"","history":"\n\n    <p>No historical information.</p>\n"}
