{"intro":"\n\t\n\t<p>The team visited the location in July 2006. It is the first location we visited that we did not discover ourselfs. This location is from the internet and cannot be found otherwise. It's hidden very well. We also took a look on a nearby shunting yard. The building is in a bad state, a fire demolished half of it, the rest is being conquered by nature. <br>\n\tThat night we camped in the neighbourhood of the shunting yard. Somehow someone discovered us camping there and called the police. Anyway they payed us a visit with two cars and eight men. After showing off, they allowed us to spend one night there. We like the Belgian police!</p>\n\t\n\t","adventure":"","history":"\n\t\n\t<p>The history of this building is a mystery to me. We found some documents dating from the 1940s, describing several wagons being damaged due to the bombardments in the second world war. So I guess the building was used by the Belgian railways, there is a big shunting yard nearby. But we found some signs inside the building in English. Probably the building remained in use after the fire, because new walls were build to close off the damaged part.</p>"}
