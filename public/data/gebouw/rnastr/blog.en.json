{"intro":"\n\n    <p>I discovered this location in May 2005 and visited it in June the same year. It is a recreational area with a fishing pond, midget golf track, snackbar, discotheque, canteen, sport fields, a camping etcetera. But everything is rather small. The bungalows at the edge of the terrain seemed to be occupied. Also there seemed to be some people (tramps?) camping at the terrain.</p>\n\n    ","adventure":"","history":"\n\n    <p>No historical background known.</p>\n"}
